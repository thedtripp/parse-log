Most Active Cookie

Given a cookie log file in the following format:

cookie,timestamp
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7,2018-12-09T14:19:00+00:00
SAZuXPGUrfbcn5UA,2018-12-09T10:13:00+00:00

Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active cookie for specified day. The example below shows how we'll execute your program.

Command:

$ ./most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09

Output:

AtY0laUfhglK3lC7


We define the most active cookie as one seen in the log the most times during a given day.

Assumptions:
•	If multiple cookies meet that criteria, please return all of them on separate lines.

$ ./most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-08

•	You're only allowed to use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing. There are libraries for most languages which make this too easy (e.g pandas) and we’d like you to show off you coding skills.
•	You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
•	You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.
•	Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is first line of the file).

We're looking for a concise, maintainable, extendable and correct solution. We're hoping you'll deliver your solution as production grade code and demonstrate:
•	good testing practices,
•	knowledge of build systems, testing frameworks, etc.
•	clean coding practices (meaningful names, clean abstractions, etc.)


Please use a programming language you’re very comfortable with. The next stage of the interview will involve extending your code.
